# Python-sorting-calculator
A sorting calculator application made using python and tkinter.

The user inputs numbers into the entry field (seperated by commas) and then clicks a button to select the method by which to sort the numbers.
The application wil display all the steps taken to sort the numbers, as well as how many total steps were needed.

This is my first project using tkinter in python and is intended as a learning tool and revision for first year of university.

Credits: I have used resources from the web to help with my code. Websites used include www.w3schools.com, www.stackoverflow.com, www.geeksforgeeks.org, www.tkdocs.com etc.
